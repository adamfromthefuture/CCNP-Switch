================================================

1: Stackwise 
    Enables seperate physical switches to be represented as one logical switch.
    This can be achieved by utilizing a special and port and cable and creating a closed connection loop.
    Daisy chain fashion, up to 9 switches.
    Extending the switchzing fabric, so frames are travelling between switches via the closed loop.

    Advantages: 
        Ring can be broken anytime to add/remove switches from the stack without interrupting operations.

    Master/Slave:
        Master: control plane, management functionalities.
        Slave: Switching functions.

    Configuration command:
    switch <number> priority <1-15>
        1 is the default

        show switch
        show platform

2: VSS
    In case of modular switches with at least one supervisor engine.
    Can configure two chassis to work as a logical switch, often VSS pair.
    One supervisor engine is going to be the primary, the other is going to be in standby.
    The two chassis must be connected through multiple links that aree configured as Virtual Switch links(VSL)

3: Supervisor and Routing Processor Redundancy
    In case of modular platforms. Hardware redundancy within Chassis. 
    
    Redundant Switch supervisors:
        Modular switch platforms can accept two supengines in a single chassis.
        First to boot up will be the active one the other is going to be the standby one waiting for the active to fail.
        Active supengine boots fully and provides switching functionalities.
        The standby supengine will boot to a level based on the configuration mode used. Config modes effects how the supengines handshake and synchronize.

        Route Processor Redundancy(RPR):
            standby supengine is partially booted
            on failover standby module must reload all modules in the chassis
            takes >2 minutes(depends on HW)

        Route Processor Redundancy Plus(RPR+):
            Standby supengine is booted, Supengine and RP is initialized.
            No L2 and L3  functions started.
            On failover, standby finishes init without rebooting linecards.
            Allows switchport to retain state.
            Takse >30 sec
        
        Stateful Switchover(SSO):
            Standby supengine is booted and initialized
            Startup and running config is in sync
            L2 information is in sync
            Interface state is in sync, links will not flap in case of failover.
            Takews >1 sec.

        SRM: Single Router Mode: Two RP is integrated and one is used at the smae time, works with SSO, not with RPR/+
        DRM: Dual Router Mode: Two RP are active in the same time.

        Configuration:
        All config changes have to be done on the active one, in case of a new setup both the active and the standby have to be configured.
        (config)# redundancy
        (config-red)# mode {rpr | rpr-plus | sso}

        show redundancy states
            look for active or standby hot

        Confiuguring Supervisor sync:
        By default the active supengine sync the startup config and the confreg with the standby one.
        (config)# redundancy
        (config-red)# main-cpu
        (config-red-main)# auto-sync{startup-config | config-register | bootvar}
        return to the default: auto-sync standard

4: NSF - Nonstop Forwarding
    Focusing on quickly rebuilding the routing table.
    Cisco Proprietary
    Have to be configured on all of the devices where you want this redundancy
    NFS can gather information from NFS aware neighbors quickly
    Supported on BGP, OSPF, EIGRP and IS-IS
