1: VLAN ACLs 
    RACLs only filter traffic packets between VLANs.
    VLAN ACLs can filter trafffic inside the VLAN.
    ACtions are permit, deny and redirect. Configured in a route map fashion.

    Configuration:
    Create an ACL:
        SW1(config)#access-list 100 permit ip host 192.168.100.1 host 192.168.100.20
    Create the VLAN Access map:
    SW1(config)#vlan access-map hundred 10
    !10 is the sequence number, order is based on the sequence number.
    SW1(config-access-map)#match ip address 100
    !Can match on MAC acl too.
    SW1(config-access-map)#action forward
    !action can be forward or drop

    Connect the VLAN ACL and the vlan(s)
    SW1(config)#vlan filter hundred vlan-list 1

2: Private VLANs
    Microsegmentationception.
    A VLAN can be logically associated with a secondary VLAN.
    A host can be configured with a primary VLAN and can communicate on it, and it have a secondary VLAN as well, but the rules for that differ based on the type.

    Type:
        Isolated: Isolated, except on the primary VLAN. Can't communicate on the secondary VLAN.
        Community: Can communicate on the primary VLAN, can communicate on the secondary VLAN and can communicate to others in that VLAN. Can't communicate to other secondary VLANs.

    All secondary VLANs must be associated with a primary VLAN.
    VTP doesn't propagate this information as it is locally significant. In case PVLANs are used throughout the network all participating must be configured accordingtly.

    Port type:
        Promiscuous: Connects to a gateway. The rules of PVLANs are ignored. Can communicate to any primary and secondary VLAN.
        Host: Connects to a regular host. Communicates only to promiscuous ports oor ports in the same community VLAN.


    The setup: 
        VLAN 1 primary VLAN.
        VLAN 10 Router5 and Mikrotik
        VLAN 20 Community: Router5, Mikrotik.

        STOP HERE, Should look at it more till sunday.
