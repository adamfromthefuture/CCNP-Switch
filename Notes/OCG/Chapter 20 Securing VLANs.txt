1: VLAN ACLs 
    RACLs only filter traffic packets between VLANs.
    VLAN ACLs can filter trafffic inside the VLAN.
    ACtions are permit, deny and redirect. Configured in a route map fashion.

    Configuration:
    Create an ACL:
        SW1(config)#access-list 100 permit ip host 192.168.100.1 host 192.168.100.20
    Create the VLAN Access map:
    SW1(config)#vlan access-map hundred 10
    !10 is the sequence number, order is based on the sequence number.
    SW1(config-access-map)#match ip address 100
    !Can match on MAC acl too.
    SW1(config-access-map)#action forward
    !action can be forward or drop

    Connect the VLAN ACL and the vlan(s)
    SW1(config)#vlan filter hundred vlan-list 1

2: Private VLANs
    Microsegmentationception.
    A VLAN can be logically associated with a secondary VLAN.
    A host can be configured with a primary VLAN and can communicate on it, and it have a secondary VLAN as well, but the rules for that differ based on the type.

    Type:
        Isolated: Isolated, except on the primary VLAN. Can't communicate on the secondary VLAN.
        Community: Can communicate on the primary VLAN, can communicate on the secondary VLAN and can communicate to others in that VLAN. Can't communicate to other secondary VLANs.

    All secondary VLANs must be associated with a primary VLAN.
    VTP doesn't propagate this information as it is locally significant. In case PVLANs are used throughout the network all participating must be configured accordingtly.

    Port type:
        Promiscuous: Connects to a gateway. The rules of PVLANs are ignored. Can communicate to any primary and secondary VLAN.
        Host: Connects to a regular host. Communicates only to promiscuous ports oor ports in the same community VLAN.

    Community ports:
        Your company is hosting servers  for two clients. You have one subnet and one primary VLAN available. You want to make sure that the communication between hosts for the same customer are possible.
    Isolated ports.
        Your company is hosting servers  for two clients. You have one subnet and one primary VLAN available. You want to make sure that the communication between hosts are not possible, except between the host and the gateway.
    Promiscuous Ports: 
        Your company provide internet breakout for multiple customers. Can be done via SVI or L2 ports.

    Community ports configuration:
    !Create Community VLANs
        SW1(config)#vlan 10
        SW1(config-vlan)#private-vlan community
        SW1(config)#vlan 20
        SW1(config-vlan)#private-vlan community
    !Create primary VLAN, and add associated VLANs.

3: Securing Trunks(DTP and VLAN hopping)
    DTP:
        Can negotiate a port to become a trunk. Risk is that an attacker can gain access to a trunk link and the vlans terminated on the switch.

        Evasion:
        SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access
        SW1(config-if)#switchport mode trunk
    
    VLAN hopping:
        An attacker on one VLAN can create frames with spoofed 802.1Q VLAN tags, packets end up in the spoofed VLAN.
        Exploit can be achieved if:
            attacker is connected to an access port
            switch has at least on 802.1Q trunk
            attacker's VLAN is the native VLAN
        
        Evasion:
            !Create bogus VLAN, configure native VLAN as the bogus VLAN. Remove bogus vlan from the allowed vlans.
                SW1(config)#vlan 900
                SW1(config-vlan)#name BLACKHOLE-DONOT-USE

                SW1(config)#interface fa0/12
                SW1(config-if)#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
                SW1(config-if)#switchport mode trunk
                SW1(config-if)#switchport trunk native vlan 900
                SW1(config-if)#switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 900

                SW1#sh interfaces trunk

                Port        Mode             Encapsulation  Status        Native vlan
                Fa0/12      on               802.1q         trunking      900

                Port        Vlans allowed on trunk
                Fa0/12      1-899,901-4094

                Port        Vlans allowed and active in management domain
                Fa0/12      1,10,20,100

                Port        Vlans in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned
                Fa0/12      none

            !Trunks will add tags to the frame for the native vlan. Double tagging attack will not work as the switch will not remove the first tag.
            SW1(config)#vlan dot1q tag native
