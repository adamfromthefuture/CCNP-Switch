1: DHCP Snooping
    Why we need DHCP Snooping?
        An attacker can build a rogue DHCP server inside the network.
        That can overtake the place of the legitimate DHCP server, by replying to client requests.
        The attacker can provide a rogue gateway and DNS address, can intercept those packets and analyze them.
        Sort of a man in the middle attack.
    
    Enabling DHCP Snooping:
        Classify switchport:
            Trusted: legitimate DHCP servers attached to the port. All DHCP messages are allowed.
                Allowed ingress messages: Offer, ACK
            Untrusted:(Default) all the other hosts. Intercept DCHP requests, drops DHCP replies silently. Only puts the violating port to err-disable if the rate limit is reached. (Written wrong in the OCG)
                Allowed ingress messages: Discover, Request/Inform, Decline, Release
    DHCP Snooping will maintain a database, will contain MAC, IP, lease time, etc. Also keeps track of completed DHCP bindings.

    Configuration:
        !Enable globally
        SW1(config)#ip dhcp snooping
        !Enable for specified VLANs
        SW1(config)#ip dhcp snooping vlan <vlan-range>

        By default DHCP Option 82 is enabled by DHCP snooping.(Relay Agent Information) Can cause issues.
        Switch intercepts the DHCP Request, adds its own MAC addres to it and valiadtes the reply based on the added values.
        !Turn it off.
        SW1(config)#no ip dhcp snooping information option 

    Verification:
        SW1#sh ip dhcp snooping
        Switch DHCP snooping is enabled
        DHCP snooping is configured on following VLANs:
        100
        DHCP snooping is operational on following VLANs:
        100
        Smartlog is configured on following VLANs:
        none
        Smartlog is operational on following VLANs:
        none
        DHCP snooping is configured on the following L3 Interfaces:

        Insertion of option 82 is disabled
        circuit-id default format: vlan-mod-port
        remote-id: 0014.f2e4.f200 (MAC)
        Option 82 on untrusted port is not allowed
        Verification of hwaddr field is enabled
        Verification of giaddr field is enabled
        DHCP snooping trust/rate is configured on the following Interfaces:

        Interface                  Trusted    Allow option    Rate limit (pps)

        Total number of bindings: 2

    Rate limiting DHCP requests.
        Can be limited on a per interface basis.
        Prevents exhausting the DHCP pool.
        SW1(config-if)#ip dhcp snooping limit rate 1

2: IP Source Guard
    Address spoofing, kind of a Denial of Service attack.
    The source address of spoofed packets is not legitimate or doesn't exist.

    Example: VLAN 10  with 10.10.10.0/24 VLAN20 forge packets to arrive on VLAN20.

    Detect and prevent address spoofing attacks, even in the same subnet.
    Based on the DHCP snooping database or static IP bindings.

    Validation:
        Source IP must be identical, to the one learnt by DHCP snooping or by static bindings. Dynamic Port ACL is created automatically to filter traffic,
        Source MAC must be identical, to the MAC learnt on the interface and learnt by DHCP snooping. Port security is used to filter traffic in this case.
    If violation happens the switch drops the packet.

    Static bindings: 0050.7966.6803
    SW1(config)#ip source binding 0050.7966.6803 vlan 100 192.168.100.10 interface fa0/10
    !Enable source guard per interface.
    SW1(config-if-range)#ip verify source    

show ip verify source 
show ip source binding

3: Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI)
    Attacker listens to an arp request and replies with a crafted ARP reply.
    The idea is to place the attacker between hosts and valid destinations.
    Attacker intercepts packets analyzes them and forwards normally, the whole process is transparent for the end users.

    This type of attack is ARP poisoning or ARP spoofing.


Switchports are classified:
    trusted: no inspection, going towards other switches and trusted equipment.
    untrusted: intercept and inspect ARP packets. Checking and validating MAC and IP addresses to trusted sources(static and dynamic entires from the DHCP snooping DB). Default.

    If violation occours packets are dropped and a log message is created.

    Configuration:
        !Enable per VLAN 
        SW1(config)#ip arp inspection vlan 100
        !Configure trusted interfaces.
        SW1(config-if)#ip arp inspection trust

    *Mar  1 01:02:15.312: %SW_DAI-4-DHCP_SNOOPING_DENY: 1 Invalid ARPs (Res) on Fa0/2, vlan 100.([b869.f427.a3ff/192.168.100.1/0050.7966.6802/192.168.100.2/01:02:14 UTC Mon Mar 1 1993])

    Static entries:
    Use when there's no DHCP.
    SW1(config)#arp access-list trusted
    SW1(config-arp-nacl)#permit ip host 192.168.100.10 mac b869.f427.a3ff ffff.ffff.ffff

    Assign ARP acl to DAI
    SW1(config)#ip arp inspection filter trusted vlan 100

    Further validation:
    src-mac: check the MAC in the ethernet header and compare to the sender MAC in the ARP reply.
    dst-mac: check the destination MAC against the target MAC
    ip: check the sender IP in all ARP requests. Check the sender IP against the target IP in all ARP replies.

    SW1(config)#ip arp inspection validate dst-mac ip src-mac

    SW1#sh ip arp ins

Source Mac Validation      : Enabled
Destination Mac Validation : Enabled
IP Address Validation      : Enabled
