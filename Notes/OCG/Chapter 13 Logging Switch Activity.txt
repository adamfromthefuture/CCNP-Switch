================================================

1: Syslog 
    System message logs, in general it is an audit trail describing important events that happened.

    Format of the IOS Syslog message has the following elements:
        Timestamp: Date and time of the internal clock, by default it is based on the uptime.
        Facility Code: begins with a %, and categorizes the software module or function
        Severity: should be a number between 0-7, the lower the number the more critical the event is.
        Mnemonic: short tag that categorizes within the facility code
        Message: description of the event

    Severity:
        7: Debugging: debug output
        6: Informational
        5: Notifications
        4: Warnings
        3: Errors
        2: Critical
        1: Alerts
        0: Emergencies

        Threshold consideration: You don't get flooded with unnecessary alerts, but you don't miss any important ones either.

    Logging to console:
        By default it is turned on and it is set debugging level.
        Change the severity:
        logging console <severity {number|keyword}>
        SW1(config)#logging console critical

        Redirect console messages to telnet or SSH: terminal monitor

    Logging to internal buffer:
        By default disabled. Switch reserves the buffer from the memory. Be cautios with this as the switch can run out of memory.
        The buffer has a finite size and operates in a circular fashion: the older messages will be overwritten once there are new messages.
        As long as the switch is powered up the logging buffer is available.

        Configuration: 
        logging buffered <severity>
        logging buffered <size> ! 4096 bytes long by default

    Logging to remote server:
        Uses UDP 314 port, and the server is capable of simultaneous data conncection.
        logging host <ip address>
        logging trap <severity>

    Adding the timestamp to a syslog message.
        By defualt the syslog messages are only showing the system uptime.
        service timestamp

2: NTP
    Setting up the internal clock:
        SW1#show clock
        *00:45:21.952 UTC Mon Mar 1 1993
    SW1#clock set 20:16:50 8 April 2019

    SW1#show clock
    SW1#show clock
    20:16:53.321 CEST Mon Apr 8 2019

    Network Time Protocol:
        Sync time from a central location. Switches will maintain their internal clock but synchronizes periodically with the server.
        NTP operates in a hierarchical fashion. An authoritative source can sync to a GPS or an atomic clock.
        Each of the layers are stratum, stratum indicates the number jumps needed to reach the top level.
        The authoritative server is stratum 1. Stratum is incremented on every layer.

        NTP modes:
            Server: synchronizes with the lowest stratum and provides sync option for higher stratum devices
            Client: device synchronizing its clock with a server 
            Peer: exchanging time information with other peers.
            Bcast/Mcast: NTP server that pushes NTP information.

            Configuration:
                ntp server <ip address> [prefer] [version 1-4 use 4 for IPv6]
                verification:
                    show clock
                    show ntp status
                    show ntp associations -> GPS: GPS Synch enabled on Peer, ACTS: Atomic clock synch.
            
    Securing NTP:
        Authentication: You can authenticate an NTP server so the client knows it can be trusted. This does not mean that the connection is encrypted.
        ntp authentication-key <key-number> md5 <string>
        ntp authenticate
        ntp trusted-key <key-number>
        ntp server <ip-address> key <key-number>

        Limit the list of IP addresses that can communicate via NTP to the switch.
        ntp access-group <option> <acl>

            Options:    
                serve-only: sync requests are permitted
                serve: sync and control requests are permitted, device can't sync it's own clock
                peer: sync and control are permitted, device can sync it's own clock
                query-only: permit only control queries
        
    SNTP: Simple NTP
        Only operates in a client-mode, it offers a reduced set of options.
        sntp authentication-key <key-number> md5 <string>
        sntp authenticate
        sntp trusted-key <key-number>
        sntp server <ip-address> key <key-number>
