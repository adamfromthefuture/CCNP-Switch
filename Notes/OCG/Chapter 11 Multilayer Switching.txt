1: InterVLAN Routing
Switching between different broadcast domains require routing.

InterVLAN routing can be achieved by:
    1: A router is connected to each VLAN via one physical interface each.
    2: A router is connected to each VLAN via on physical interface(trunk - Router on a stick)
    3: Multilayer switch, where routing and switching is combined.

Interface types:
    L2 interface
        configure with the switchport interface sublevel command, further configuration is required(access | trunk)
    L3 interface
        configure with the no switchport interface sublevel command, furhter configuration is required: ip addres etc.
    SVI

2: Router on a stick
Concept, you have a pure L2 switch with multiple VLANs. Since the switch is lacking L3 capabilities, you need a router to connect two VLANs configured on the switch.

Assign the switch interfaces on SW1 to the right VLAN and configure the interfaces for L3 operation on SW2 and 3.
Verify by pinging from SW2 to SW3 and generate traceroute as well-> Should work if not check routing, or if routing is enabled on Router5, or if trunk is set properly, or if access interfaces are properly configured.

3: SVI:
    Switch(ed) Virtual Interface: a logical L3 interface that represents a whole VLAN.
    SVI IP address will be the default gateway for that particular VLAN, so hosts can communicate via that with outside network.
    To configure, first make sure that the VLAN in question is assigned to an L2 interface and that interface is UP and functional.

    SVI autostate: SVI can't become active until an L2 port is assigned to that VLAN. So no switching and routing functions can use the SVI before the VLAN is ready.
        Workaround can be implemented even if L2 is not ready, configure when needed: eg.: port mirroring. 
        <interface> switchport autostate exclude
    
    By creating the SVI interface, the VLAN is not created. You have to enable the SVI to make it functional after the VLAN is created and assigned to an L2 port.
    Routing between two VLANs on two switches: both switches must have SVIs in both VLANs.
    IP routing: (config)# ip routing  must be enabled.

    Configuration:
        SW1#sh run interface vlan 150
        Building configuration...

        Current configuration : 65 bytes
        !
        interface Vlan150
        ip address 192.168.150.1 255.255.255.0
        no shut
        end

        SW1#sh run interface fastEthernet 0/11
        Building configuration...

        Current configuration : 86 bytes
        !
        interface FastEthernet0/11
        switchport access vlan 150
        switchport mode access
        end

4: CEF
Cisco Express Forwarding

Traditional MLS works by the method, route once switch many. The process requires a Route Processor and Switch Processor.

CEF Overview:
    Hight performance packet forwarding using dynamic lookup tables. Runs by default on Cisco Catalyst. Cisco proprietary.

Elements of CEF:
    Layer 3 Engine:
        Routing table and ARP tables
        Purpose is to build routing information base


    Layer 3 Forwarding Engine:
        FIB and Adjacency table
        Purpose is switching pakcets based on Layer 3 Engine

    Forwarding Information Base(FIB)
        Reformatted and ordered list of routing information. With the most specific information first for each destination subnet.
        Contains routing and forwarding information that the prefix is referenced on, and also contains next hop address and host routes.

        FIB is dynamic, and can be updated by:
            Layer 3 Engine notices a change in the topology
            Routing table is updated
            ARP record changed or aged out
    
    After FIB is built packets can be forwarded by the Layer 3 Forwarding Engine, which will start hardware switching process.

    Display FIB entries:
    show ip cef

    CEF Punt:
        Packets that can't be hardware switched and sent to the Layer 3 Engine for further processing

        Root causes:
            Entry cannot be located in the FIB
            FIB Table is full
            TTL expired
            MTU exceeded, means that the packet must be fragmented
            ICMP redirect received
            Encapsulation not supported
            Packets are tunneled, requireing compression or encryption
            ACL with logging triggered
            NAT operation

    CEF Optimization:
        Accelerated CEF(aCEF)
            CEF distributed accross multiple L3 Forwarding Engines(Individual Linecards)
            L3 Forwarding Engines only have the capacity to hold portions of the full FIB, if no match is detected for a packet the L3 engine will be queried.
            CEF is accelerated on the linecards, but not necessarily at a sustained wire speed rate. 

        Distributed CEF(dCEF)
            CEF is distributed among multiple L3 Forwarding Engines.
            A central L3 engine maintaing the routing table, and also generates the FIB which is then downloaded to each line card.

    Adjacency table:
        Portion of the FIB that holds L2 information for every next hop or in other words MAC address of all L2 nodes that are reachable within a single L2 hop.

        CEF Glean state:
            Happens when an ARP entry doesn't exist for a next hop. L3 Forwarding Engine canno√∂t forward the apckets in HW as because of the missing L2 address.
            show ip cef adjacency glean

        ARP Throttling/throttling adjacency:
            CEF glean is waiting for the resolution, meanwhile the arp packets to the host are dropped, so the L3 engine doesn't become busy.
            If an arp reply is not received within 2 seconds throttling is released.

        Adjacency Types:
            Null:
                Used to switch packes destined to the Null interface(logical blackhole Ineterface/Null0)
            Drop:
                Packets that cannot be forwarded normally are dropped without forwarding. Can be dropped due to:
                    encapsulation failure, unresolved address, unsupported protocol, no valid route, no valid adjacency, checksum error.
                show cef drop
            Discard:
                Packets must be discarded because of an ACL or policy discard
            Punt:
                When packets must be sent to L3 engine for further processing.
                show cef not-cef-switched
    
    Packet rewrite:
        Packet header information must be rewritten before forwarding.
        Packet rewrite engine does the following:
            L2 destination address: change to Next Hop MAC
            L2 source address: change to outbound MAC
            L3 IP TTL: decrement by 1
            L3 IP Checksum: recalculated to include changes in the IP header.
            L2 Frame Checksum: recalculated to include chnages to the L2 and L3 headers

Configuring CEF:
        Enabled by default on Catalyst
        Possible not to disable on some platforms.
        Can be disabled globally or per interface.
        Should always be enabled, except when you need to disable CEF for debugging.
        no ip cef
        no ip route-cache
