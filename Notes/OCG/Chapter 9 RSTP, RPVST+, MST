================================================

1:RSTP
    1: Overview
    802.1W, IEEE Standard. Based on 802.1D principles, but with faster convergence time.
    RSTP is not a standalone protocol!!! It is an extension for various STP flavors, in fact it is an underlying mechanism.
    To use RSTP you have to use either RPVST+ or MST.
    Root bridge election goes as normal, preference goes towards lowest Bridge ID.

    2: Port Roles
    After the root bridge is identified the follwoing port roles are determined.
    > Root port: The ONE port that has the lowest root path cost. Root bridges will not have any root ports.
    > Designated port: The switch port on a network segment that has the lowest root path cost.
    > Alternate Port: Alternative path to the Root Bridge, that is less desirable than the current port/path.
    > Backup port: redundant port to a segment where other switches are connected to.

    3: Port States
    Newly introduced port states will describe what happens with incoming frames.
    > Discarding: All incoming frames are dropped. Combines: Blocking, Listening and Disabled.
    > Learning: Incoming frames are dropped but MAC addresses are learnt and put in to the MAC address table.
    > Forwarding: Incoming frames are forwarded or discarded, based on higher levle decisions.

    4: BPDU
    BPDUs are backward compatible to 802.1D. One field is used in extra: Message Type field.
    An interactive process is used to negotiate changes between two neighboring switches.
    BPDUs are sent out every Hello interval. In case 3 BPDUs were not received the neighbor will be presumed down and all information from that neighbor is aged out immediatelly.
    This reduces convergence time from 20 seconds to 6 seconds.

    STP and RSTP BPDUs can coexist, and if a 802.1D BPDU is received on a port, that port will operate according to 802.1D.
    Protocol can be change if the Migration Delay expires(3 seconds).

    5: Convergence
    The state of independence of the switches is overwritten to a uniformity, in which each and every switch has a place in the loop free tree topology.

    To support this uniformity a two stage process is initiated:
        1: Root bridge is elected. One Switch to Rule Them All.
        2: Each port is in teh appropriate state.

    When a switch joins the topology, RSTP demands to take decisions based on the port type.

        Port Types:
        > Edge Port: Is located at the edge of the network, where only a single host is connected to. Portfast concept is followed, the port jumps to Forwarding directly.
        > Root Port: The port has the best root path cost. Only one can be active at a time. Alternative ports are activated once the root port failes.
        > Point-to-Point: Any port that connects to an other switch and becomes a designated port.
    
    Handshake is implemented to decide the port types. BPDUs are exchanged as proposal<->agreement.
    If there is an agreement the port becomes a full duplex port.
    Half duplex port will show that there's a shared medium between switches, so 802.1D is used.

    Change propagation is done via handshake as well. It will generate a handshake wave going towards the edge of the network.
    During handshakes every switch has to evaluate whether it will introduce a loop or not.

    6: Synchronization
    Switch revceives a proposal message and then the following process is kicked out:
        1: If a superior BPDU is received the sender should be the designated switch(The sender port is a designated port). Own port must be a root port.
        2: Before a switch agrees to anything, it must synch itself to the topology
        3: All nonedge ports are put to Discarding so no network loops can appear.
        4: Agreement is sent back to the sender, Sender will know that the switch is synching itself
        5: Root port is moved to forwarding state
        6: On nonedge ports in Discarding state a proposal message is sent.
        7: Agreement message is expected and received.
        8: Nonedge ports move to Forwarding.
    
    Convergence happens at the speed of BPDU transmission, there are no timers invlolved.

    If a designated port doesn't recive an agreemnent(Other side not using RSTP) the port must operate according to 802.1D.

    7: Topology Changes:
    RSTP detects topology changes when a nonedge port moves to Forwarding state. Link failure is not a trigger.
    Upon topology change the switch must propagate the changes, TC BPDUs with the TC bit set are sent out on nonedge ports.
    This process is done until the TC timer expires(2 hello timer).
    All MAC addresses associated with the nonedge designated ports are flushed, addresses to be relearnt.
    All neighboring switches receiving TC must flush MAC address table.

3: MST
    1: Overview
    Mapping one or more VLANs to a single STP process.

    Considerations before implementation:
        Number of STP instances needed
        Mapping of VLANs to Instances

    MST Region:
    Figureing out which neighbor is using which STP type.
    This done by configuring switches into common MST regions.

    Common Region Attributes:
    > MST Config name(32 Char)
    > MST config revision(0 to 65535)
    > MST instance to VLAN Mapping
        If two switches have the same attributes, they are in the same region. MST BPDUs will contain the attributes, so a switch can compare the received attributes to the local ones.
        Mapping table is not sent over as it is locally configured. There is no mechanism to control the mapping centrally.

    IST instances:
        Internal spanning tree instance, that makes the internal network to look like it's one big switch.
        Runs within MST region.
