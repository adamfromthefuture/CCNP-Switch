1: Root Bridge Placement
During the placement of the root bridge you have to take the following in consideration:
    Root bridge should be in a central location
    Root bridge should be a high performance switch

Extended system-id: 4 bits of priority multiplier and 12 bits VLAN-id.
Enabled by default.
Configure extended system-id:
spanning-tree extended system-id

Setting the root bridge:
A.: Manual
B.: Automatic placement(macro like command set)
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A.: Manual root bridge placement.
Preference is towards the lowest root priority.
Configuration:
    spanning-tree vlan <vlan-id> priority <priority number, increment of 4096>

By default SW2 is the root bridge for VLAN 1 in my lab. We are going to attempt to change the root bridge to SW1.

B.: Automatic placement:
Macro like root bridge placement.
Optimizes values so the devices should become the root bridge. Only happens once, so in case a new switch is added to the network, it is possible to replace the root bridge.
With the macro you can specify the primary and the secondary bridge.
!!!Disclaimer!!! Automatic method doesn't guarantee the root role.
Diameter: number of switches under the root bridge in one branch.

2: Path Selection

STP Path selection happens based on:
1. Lowest Bridge ID(BID) -  MAC 
2. Lowest root path Cost
3. Lowest sender bridge ID
4. Lowest sender port ID

Tuning and verifying the root path cost:
Can be done on a per vlan or per interface basis.
!!!Tune it on the downstream device!!!

3: Timers
Adjusting timers can tune the convergence times.
Should only be configured/changed on the root bridge. Timers will be propagated via BPDUs.
Timers can be changed per VLAN basis.

Be careful with changing the timers as you can easily cause loops if the changes are not planned properly.

STP Timers:
  > Hello timer 
  > Forward Delay
  > Max Age

1: Hello Timer: 
  Defines: Sending configuration BPDUs on a regular basis, from the root bridge to other switches. Bridges expect to receive BPDU messages else, they will assume catastrophic events.
  Possible values: 1-10 seconds, 2 by default

  Configure: 
  SW2(config)#spanning-tree vlan 1  hello-time 5

  Verify: 
  SW2#sh spanning-tree vlan 1 | i Hello
              Hello Time   5 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec
              Hello Time   5 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec

2: Forward Delay
  Defines: The time the switchport spends in Listening and Learning state.
  Possible values: 4-30 seconds, default 15. Please note, if forward delay time is set too low, it might allow loops to form and can cripple the network.
  Configure:
  SW2(config)#spanning-tree vlan 1 forward-time 4

  Verify:
  SW2#sh spanning-tree vlan 1 | i Forw
              Hello Time   5 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay  4 sec
              Hello Time   5 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay  4 sec

3: Max Age
  Defines: Lifetime of the stored BPDUs.

  Possible values: 6-40 seconds, default is 20 seconds.

  Configure:
  SW2(config)#spanning-tree vlan 1 max-age 6

  Verify:
  SW2#sh spanning-tree vlan 1 | i Max
              Hello Time   5 sec  Max Age  6 sec  Forward Delay  4 sec
              Hello Time   5 sec  Max Age  6 sec  Forward Delay  4 sec

4: Redundant Link Convergence
Methods/Enhancements that allow faster convergence.
  1: Portfast
    Used on acces layer, ports where only workstations or endpoints are connected to.
    Portfast allows to skip several STP port statuses and put the port directly to Forwarding state.
    Loop detection will still be operational on the port, and if a loop is detected the port moves to Blocking state.
    
    Configure: Disabled by default.
      A: Enable on all non-trunking interfaces.
      SW2(config)#spanning-tree portfast default
      %Warning: this command enables portfast by default on all interfaces. You
      should now disable portfast explicitly on switched ports leading to hubs,
      switches and bridges as they may create temporary bridging loops.

      B: Enable/Disable per interface
      SW2(config)#interface range fastEthernet 0/19-24
      SW2(config-if-range)#no spanning-tree portfast

      C: Enable PortFast for trunks:
      SW2(config)#interface fastEthernet 0/11
      SW2(config-if)#spanning-tree portfast trunk
      %Warning: portfast should only be enabled on ports connected to a single
      host. Connecting hubs, concentrators, switches, bridges, etc... to this
      interface  when portfast is enabled, can cause temporary bridging loops.
      Use with CAUTION

    Verify:
    My switches haven't negotiated trunking and I don't have trunks configured, so the interface going towards an other switch is enabled with portfast.
    SW2#show spanning-tree interface fastEthernet 0/24 portfast
    VLAN0001            enabled

    Debug:
    debug spanning-tree events

    *Mar  1 00:36:49.718: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/24, changed state to up

    After disabling portfast on switch links:
    SW2#sh spanning interface fa0/24 portfast
    VLAN0001            disabled

  Good to know: 
    If you enable voice VLAN feature, portfast is enabled. If you disable the voice VLAN Portfast will still be enabled.
    SW1(config-if)#interface fa0/11
    SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access
    SW1(config-if)#switchport access vlan 10
    SW1(config-if)#switchport voice vlan 20
    SW1(config-if)#do sh span int fa 0/11 port
    VLAN0010            enabled
    VLAN0020            enabled

    !Removing voice VLAN
    SW1(config-if)#no switchport voice vlan
    SW1(config-if)#do sh span int fa 0/11 port
    VLAN0010            enabled

  2: Uplinkfast
    Used on ports that the switch can potentially use to reach the root bridge.(Both blocking and forwarding ports) <-These are called as an Uplink Group.
    If the forwarding port failes an other port from the Uplink Group will become active.
    The port will go immediatelly from Blocking to Forwarding state.
    If the original port comes back up, the switch will wait 2 times the Forward delay, to become the root port again.
  
    Enabling uplinkfast will prevent the switch from becoming the root bridge, by setting the priority to 49152+VLAN ID, and port cost will be increased by 3000.

    Cutover: The switch sends dummy multicast frames to 0100.00cd.cdcd. Dummy multicast frame will be sent for every single MAC address in the MAC address table.
      This is needed due to the fact that the MAC address table might not age out before the cutover happens and the switch starts forwarding.
    
    Where to implement: Anywhere, except Core to Distribution links, Cisco does not recommend it.
     
    Configure: 
    Cannot be configure on a per VLAN basis, it's one for all.

  3: BackboneFast
    Cisco proprietary feature. Have to be implemented on all switches.
    Used for indirect link failures. Indirect link is a link not connected to the local switch.
    Detected when inferior BPDU is received. Inferior BPDU=Receive multiple BPDUs from multiple devices after the know path to the root is lost.
    Esentially what BackboneFast will do is skip the Max Age Stage, and use RLQ=Root Link query.
    RLQ works like echo and reply, messages are request and response.
    Request: is sent by the switch detecting indirect link outage. Sent by the port receiving the BPDUs. Message will contain the ID of the Root switch.
    Response: the switch sending inferior BPDus will check whether the known root bridge is the same as in the Request.

    Configure:(On all switches)
