================================================
1: SPAN
    Switched Port Analyzer
    Feature to mirror traffic from one or many switchports/vlan to a destination port.
    Packet sniffer can be attached to this port, incoming packets are marked so they can be copied to the destination port. -> Packet sniffer receives the exact copy fo the packets.
   
    SPAN sources can be:
        interfaces belonging to the same or different VLAN
        trunk
        a VLAN active on a trunk
        a memmber of an etherchannel
        a port channel
        a specific VLAN -> VSPAN, all interfaces belonging to the VLAN will be monitored
    
    SPAN direction can be set to:
        Receive
        Transmit
        Both

    Number of SPAN session depends on the hardware. C3750-x=2, C6500=64.

2: Local SPAN
    Source and Destination is located on the same swithch or in the same logical stack.

    Destination: 
        Interface on the switch or in the logical stack.
        The frames are mirrored from the source and put to the egress queue to the destination. The original data is handled as normal.

    Speed difference:
        In case there's a mismatch between the source and destination port speed, if the destination interface is congested the mirrored frames get dropped, original frames are handled normally.

    Configuration:
            100.20                               100.30
            +---------+                          +---------+
            |         |           Fa0/21         |         |
            |   SW2   +--------------------------+   SW3   |
            |         |                          |         |
            +---------+                          +---------+
                |Fa0/11

            +---------+

        Configuration had to be implemented on SW2 only:
            SW2(config)#monitor session 1 source interface fastEthernet 0/21 both
            SW2(config)#monitor session 1 destination interface fastEthernet 0/11

        VLAN Filter, for monitoring specific VLANs only
            SW2(config)#monitor session 1 filter vlan 1

        By default the destination port can only receive data from the switch, in case data needs to be received from the port configure:
            SW2(config)#$sion 1 destination interface fastEthernet 0/21 ingress

        To capture VLAN Tagging
            SW2(config)#$tination interface fastEthernet 0/11 encapsulation replicate

3: Remote SPAN(RSPAN)
    Source and Destination can be on different switches, or different locations.
    Mirrored data is carried over a special purpose VLAN.

    MAC learning is disabled, to prevent intermediate switches to forward traffic to their real desitnations.
    STP is running on the VLAN, for loop prevention.
    RSPAN switches are flooding the mirrored traffic to all ports belonging to the RSPAN VLAN.
    RSPAN VLAN should be allowed on trunks but should not be assigned to any ports alongt the path.

    Configuration
    Define the VLAN   
        SW2(config)#vlan 999
        SW2(config-vlan)#remote-span
        SW2(config-vlan)#name SPAN 
        
    Make sure the VLAN is pruned through the trunk links.

    Source:
        SW3(config)#monitor session 1 source interface fa0/4 both
        SW3(config)#monitor session 1 destination remote vlan 999

    Destination:
        SW2(config)#monitor session 1 source remote vlan 999
        SW2(config)#monitor session 1 destination interface fa0/11

    Verification:
        SW2#sh monitor session 1
        Session 1
        ---------
        Type                   : Remote Destination Session
        Source RSPAN VLAN      : 999
        Destination Ports      : Fa0/11
            Encapsulation      : Native
                Ingress      : Disabled
