1: Port Security 
    Control port access based on the MAC address.
    SW1(config)#interface fastEthernet 0/11
    SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security

    It is possible to specify the number of dynamically learnt MAC addresses, the default is 1 and the highest possible value is 1024:
    In case of user access ports, count with an extra MAC address for an IP Phone.
    SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security  maximum 2

    Aging is possible, but not set by default.
    By default learnt MAC addresses are put in the CAM table.
    It is possible to make a learnt address persistent. This will save the mac address in the running configuration.
    SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security mac-address sticky
    interface FastEthernet0/11
    switchport mode access
    switchport port-security maximum 2
    switchport port-security
    switchport port-security mac-address sticky
    switchport port-security mac-address sticky ba9a.dbb0.9512

    In case the switch reloads the mac the will have to be learnt again.

    It is possible to assign an allowed MAC address to an interface manually.
    SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security mac ba9a.dbb0.9511
    Replaced the last charecter of the MAC address with a different one on purpose so a violation happens.
    *Mar  1 00:19:40.579: %PM-4-ERR_DISABLE: psecure-violation error detected on Fa0/11, putting Fa0/11 in err-disable state
    *Mar  1 00:19:40.579: %PORT_SECURITY-2-PSECURE_VIOLATION: Security violation occurred, caused by MAC address ba9a.dbb0.9512 o port FastEthernet0/11.

    In case the number of the statically assigned MAC addresses are lower than the maximum amount, dynamically learnt MAC addresses can be used.

    In case of violation there are three ways port security can react:
        Shutdown: the default one, puts the interface into errdisablemode.
        Restrict: port stays up, all packet from the violating MAC address are dropped and keeps a count of the violating packets. Can send an SNMP trap or a Syslog Message
        Protect: port stays up, packets are dopped but no records are left.
    SW1(config-if)#switchport port-security violation restrict

    Verification commads:
    show port security[interface]
    show interfaces status err-disabled

2: Dot1X
    IEEE Standard
    Combination of AAA authentication and port-security

    When configured a switchport is not enabled until a user has authenticated with the switch on the port.

    Terminology:
        Supplicant: Client, trying to authenticate
        Authenticator: The switch where the Client tries to authenticate on.
        Authentication Server: Validating authentication attempt.

    To work properly, Switch and the PC must support 802.1x using Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN(EAPOL).
    EAPOL is an L2 Protocol

    In case the PC supports .1x but the switch doesn't, the PC will communicate normally and abandons using the protocol.
    On the other way around the switchport will be in unauthorized state and will drop traffic.
    
    Both the switch and the client can ijnitiate authentication.
    Dot1X only supports Radius.

    Configuration:
        Step 1: Enable AAA
            SW1(config)#aaa new-model
            new model means that the authentication will use method list
        Step 2: define radius server
            SW1(config)#radius-server host 192.168.100.1 key 0 cisco
        Step 3: create authentication method
            SW1(config)#aaa authentication dot1x default group radius
        Step 4: Enable Dot1X
            SW1(config)#dot1x system-auth-control
        Step 5: Configure the ports to use dot1x
            SW1(config-if)#authentication port-control {auto | force-authorized | force-unauthorized}
                force-authorized: Default state, no authentication is required. 
                force-unauthorized: forced to never authorize, port cannot move to authorized state.
                auto: uses dot1x to exchange packets to move from unauthorized to authorized.
        Step 6: Allow multiple hosts on an interface.
            SW1(config-if)#authentication host-mode multi-host

3: Storm Control
    To avoid issues coming from frames that have a destination MAC address which is either not specific or cannot be located.
        Broadcast frames
        Multicast frames
        Unknown Unicast frames
    Traffic where frames have to be flooded.


    Storm control is configured per interface and per protocol:
        SW1(config-if)#storm-control broadcast level 90 89
        Can be specified in percentage, bits per sec or packets per sec.

    Specify an action storm control should take upon violation.
    SW1(config-if)#storm-control action shutdown
        shutdown to put the interface to err-disabled or trap to send a message 

    *Mar  1 01:30:54.121: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/12, changed state to down
    *Mar  1 01:30:55.120: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface FastEthernet0/12, changed state to down

4: Best practices
    Secure passwords: use enable secrets instead of enable passwords
    Service password encryption.
    Use banners: warn unauthorized users. banner motd
    Secure the web interface: TURN IT OFF. no ip http server, ip http secure server
    Secure console access
    Secure VTY access, with an ACL and remote authentication
    Use SSH
    Secure SNMP
    Shutdown unused ports
    Secure STP: like BPDUGuard
    Turn off CDP and LLDP, enable only on devices where the connected devices can be trusted.
