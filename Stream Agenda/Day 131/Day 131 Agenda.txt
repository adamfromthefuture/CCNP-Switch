            Day 131 Agenda
=================================================
Self Assessment:
    Working until Tuesday next week and then I'm off for the end of the month.
    Feeling burnt out: more is work related, some related to the exam, some on family matters.

    I was lazy, but I did it on purpose to recover from the daily stuff.
