            Day 120 Agenda
=================================================
Day off from work

INE Workbook grind today.

1.2 VLANs and VTP Guidelines:
    1: Use VTP version that supports token ring
        vtp version 2

    2: Make sure that only SW1 can add or remove and propagate VLANs
        vtp mode server

    3: Make sure that the rest of the switches can only add or remove VLANs based on the received VTP messages. Changes to the VLAN database locally should be prohibited.
        vtp mode client

    4: All switches should be in the same domain cisco
        vtp domain cisco
        *Jun  3 12:03:45.715: %SW_VLAN-6-VTP_DOMAIN_NAME_CHG: VTP domain name changed to cisco.

    5: VTP messages should be sent with the hash of cisco as a password
        vtp password cisco
        !password is going to be hashed with MD5 by default.

    6: Configure VLANs 2-5 and make sure they are propagated

1.3: VLAN Trunks:
    1: We should use 802.1q and trunks should be negotiated by DTP.
        switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
        switchport mode dynamic desirable

    2: In case DTP doesn't receive keepalives, automatically put the interface to access port into vlan 2
        switchport access vlan 2

    3: Untagged traffic should flow via VLAN 3
        switchport trunk native vlan 3
    
    Verification:
    show interface trunk
    sh interfaces switchport | i  (Name|Access)

1.4: Etherchannel
    1: Negotiate an Etherchannel between SW1 and SW2 with PAgP
        channel-protocol pagp
        channel-group 1 mode desirable
        !other side
        channel-group 1 mode auto

    Verification:
        show etherchannel summary

1.5 Switchport and Switch IP configuration:
    1: Enable and configure the links between the switches and the routers according to the diagram.

    2: Router facing port should never participate in DTP
        switchport mode access

    3: Configure the management VLAN
        interface vlan 1
        ip address 1.1.1.x 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown

    4: Verification:
        ping between two routers on the same VLAN 
        ping between switches

2.1 SVI configuration:
    1: Configure and verify the SVI-s 2-5
        interface vlan 2
         ip address 10.10.10.9 255.255.255.248
         no shutdown
        interface vlan 3
         ip address 10.10.10.33 255.255.255.248
         no shutdown
        interface vlan 4
         ip address 30.30.30.1 255.255.255.192
         no shutdown
        interface vlan 5
         ip address 20.20.20.97 255.255.255.224
         no shutdown
    2: Verify SVIs and IP reachability
        show ip interfaces brief | e una    
    3: Enable IP Routing
        ip routing

2.2 DHCP server
    1: Turn SW1 into a DHCP server and the Routers to be DHCP clients.
        ip dhcp pool vlan2
         network 10.10.10.8 /29
         default-router 10.10.10.9
        exit
        ip dhcp pool vlan3
         network 10.10.10.32 /29
         default-router 10.10.10.33
        exit
        ip dhcp pool vlan4
         network 30.30.30.0 /26
         default-router 30.30.30.1
        exit
        ip dhcp pool vlan5
         network 20.20.20.97 /27
         default-router 20.20.20.97
        exit
