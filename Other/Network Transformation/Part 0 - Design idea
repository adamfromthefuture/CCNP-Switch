Why:
Not fit for the purpose.
Design flaws, both performance, feature set and security.

Current setup:
Mikrotik all in one: https://mikrotik.com/product/CRS109-8G-1S-2HnD-IN
VLAN: 20, 30
Proxmox

Future setup:
VLAN:

PiHole & Squid:
    Ad blocking, DNS level restrictions.
    Squid proxy, with SSL intercept.

VPN:
    Mikrotik or OpenVPN based. Internet gateway for certain profiles, and it should provide stub VPN for others(people using the lab).

How:
    Design phase: This video + drawing and detailed plans.
    Interim phases: 
        Setting up PiHole and/or Squid
        Jumpserver rework: new VM
        VLANs and subnets
    VPN.
    Cutover after each item is tested.
